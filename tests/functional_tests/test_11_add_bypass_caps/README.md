# Test Case 11: Adding Bypass Capacitors in KiCad

## Objective
Test the ability to add bypass capacitors in KiCad and sync them back to Python code.

## Test Scenario
1. Create an MCU circuit without bypass capacitors in Python
2. Generate KiCad project
3. In KiCad:
   - Add bypass capacitors near IC power pins
   - Add proper power and ground connections
   - Follow best practices for placement
   - Add appropriate values and footprints
4. Import changes back to Python
5. Verify new components are integrated into the circuit

## Expected Results
- New bypass capacitors appear in Python code
- Connections to power/ground nets are preserved
- Component references are properly assigned
- Circuit maintains all original functionality

## Key Aspects Tested
- Adding new components in KiCad
- Power net connection handling
- Component reference assignment
- Integration with existing circuit
