# Test Case 12: Footprint Changes for Manufacturing

## Objective
Test the ability to change component footprints in KiCad for manufacturing requirements and sync back to Python.

## Test Scenario
1. Create a circuit with small SMD components (0402) in Python
2. Generate KiCad project
3. In KiCad:
   - Change 0402 resistors to 0603 for hand assembly
   - Change some capacitors to 0805 for higher voltage rating
   - Convert THT components to SMD equivalents
   - Update connector footprints for availability
4. Import changes back to Python
5. Verify all footprint changes are preserved

## Expected Results
- Updated footprints appear in Python code
- Component values and connections remain unchanged
- All footprint library references are correct
- Circuit functionality is maintained

## Key Aspects Tested
- Footprint property synchronization
- Library reference handling
- THT to SMD conversion
- Manufacturing constraint adaptation
