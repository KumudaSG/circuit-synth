# Test Case 13: Adding Test Points and Debug Connectors

## Objective
Test the ability to add test points and debug connectors in KiCad for prototype debugging.

## Test Scenario
1. Create a functional circuit without test points in Python
2. Generate KiCad project
3. In KiCad:
   - Add test points on critical signals
   - Add programming header for microcontroller
   - Add debug UART connector
   - Add power measurement points
   - Add ground test points near sensitive circuits
4. Import changes back to Python
5. Verify all test points and connectors are integrated

## Expected Results
- New test points appear in Python code with proper connections
- Debug connectors are added with correct pinouts
- All original circuit functionality is preserved
- Test points have appropriate footprints

## Key Aspects Tested
- Adding debugging infrastructure
- Test point integration
- Connector addition and pinout
- Signal accessibility improvements
