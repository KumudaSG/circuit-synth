description: Analyze signal integrity and suggest optimal routing strategies\n---\n\nAnalyze the current circuit design for signal integrity and provide routing optimization recommendations.

ðŸš€ **Signal Integrity Analysis**

**Analysis Scope:**
1. **Critical Signal Identification**: Find high-speed, clock, and sensitive analog signals
2. **Layer Stack Recommendations**: Suggest optimal PCB stackup for signal integrity
3. **Impedance Control**: Calculate trace impedance requirements
4. **EMI/EMC Considerations**: Identify potential interference sources
5. **Routing Constraints**: Generate circuit-synth placement constraints

**Use the signal-integrity agent** to provide expert recommendations including:
- Critical signal path analysis and routing guidelines
- PCB stackup recommendations with cost considerations
- Component placement optimization for signal integrity
- Design rule constraints integrated into circuit-synth code

**Deliverables:**
- Signal integrity analysis report
- Routing guidelines and constraints
- Updated circuit-synth code with placement requirements
- Critical signal documentation and test point recommendations
