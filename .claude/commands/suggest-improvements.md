ðŸ¤– **AI-Powered Design Optimization**

**Optimization Analysis:**
1. **Performance Enhancement**: Identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities
2. **Cost Reduction**: Find lower-cost alternatives without compromising performance
3. **Reliability Improvement**: Suggest additional protection and robustness measures
4. **Manufacturing Optimization**: Improve DFM and reduce assembly complexity
5. **Future-Proofing**: Recommend design changes for scalability and upgrades

**AI Analysis Process:**
- Use circuit-architect agent for high-level optimization strategy
- Employ specialized agents (power-expert, signal-integrity, component-guru)
- Cross-reference with memory-bank patterns and best practices
- Generate ranked improvement suggestions with impact analysis

**Improvement Categories:**
- **Quick Wins**: Low-effort, high-impact improvements
- **Performance Upgrades**: Significant performance gains with moderate effort
- **Cost Optimizations**: Reduce BOM cost while maintaining functionality
- **Reliability Enhancements**: Improve robustness and fault tolerance
- **Future Enhancements**: Prepare for next-generation requirements

**Suggestion Format:**
For each improvement:
- **Impact**: Quantitative benefit (cost savings, performance gain, etc.)
- **Effort**: Implementation complexity and required changes
- **Risk**: Assessment of potential negative impacts
- **Implementation**: Specific circuit-synth code changes required
- **Verification**: How to validate the improvement effectiveness
