description: Validate design for manufacturing readiness and DFM compliance\n---\n\nComprehensive manufacturing readiness assessment for the current circuit design.

🏭 **Manufacturing Validation**

**Assessment Areas:**
1. **Component Availability**: Real-time JLC stock verification for all components
2. **Assembly Capability**: Validate against JLC assembly process capabilities
3. **Design for Manufacturing**: Check DFM rules and constraints
4. **Cost Optimization**: Analyze BOM costs across quantity breaks
5. **Lead Time Analysis**: Assess supply chain risks and delivery timelines

**Use the component-guru agent** to provide detailed manufacturing analysis:
- Complete component availability report with alternatives
- DFM compliance checking and recommendations
- Cost optimization suggestions with quantity break analysis
- Supply chain risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**Manufacturing Report Includes:**
- ✅/❌ Manufacturing readiness status for each component
- Alternative component suggestions with equivalent specs
- Cost analysis across different quantity tiers
- Lead time estimates and supply chain risk factors
- PCBA assembly feasibility and any special requirements
