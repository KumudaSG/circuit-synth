description: Validate design against safety and regulatory standards\nargument-hint: [region: CE, FCC, UL, etc.]\n---\n\nComprehensive regulatory compliance assessment for target markets.

üìã **Compliance Validation** for region: $ARGUMENTS

**Regulatory Assessment:**
1. **Safety Standards**: UL, IEC, EN safety requirements analysis
2. **EMC Compliance**: Electromagnetic compatibility for target regions
3. **Environmental**: RoHS, REACH, conflict minerals compliance
4. **Wireless**: RF emissions and SAR requirements if applicable
5. **Industry Specific**: Medical, automotive, industrial standards

**Compliance Analysis Process:**
- Review circuit design against applicable standards
- Identify potential compliance risks and mitigation strategies
- Suggest design modifications for regulatory compliance
- Provide documentation requirements and test procedures

**Compliance Report Includes:**
- ‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå Compliance status for each applicable standard
- Required design modifications for compliance
- Test procedures and certification requirements
- Documentation and labeling requirements
- Estimated compliance testing costs and timelines

**Design Modifications:**
- Updated circuit-synth code with compliance constraints
- Component selection changes for regulatory compliance
- PCB layout requirements for EMC compliance
- Additional protection circuits if required
