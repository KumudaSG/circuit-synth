# 🎉 FINAL WORKING KiCad-Claude Integration Setup

## ✅ SOLUTION: Super Short Filename

The issue was KiCad corrupting command lines with special characters in filenames. The working solution uses the shortest possible filename.

## 🚀 WORKING COMMAND (Copy Exactly)

```
/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 "/Users/shanemattner/Documents/KiCad/9.0/scripting/plugins/ai.py" "%I" "%O"
```

## 📋 KiCad Setup Steps

1. **Open KiCad Schematic Editor**
2. **Tools → Generate Bill of Materials**  
3. **Click "+" to add NEW plugin**
4. **Plugin Settings:**
   - **Name:** `AI Assistant`
   - **Command Line:** Copy the exact command above
5. **Test:** Select "AI Assistant" and click "Generate"

## 🎯 Expected Results

**✅ What You Should See:**
- Window title: "Circuit-Synth AI - Claude Assistant (THREADED)"
- Status: "✅ Claude Connected & Ready!" (green)
- No crashes when sending messages
- Button shows "Sending..." during API calls
- Smooth conversation with Claude about your circuit

**❌ If You See Problems:**
- Check that you copied the EXACT command (no line breaks)
- Verify the filename is exactly `ai.py` (very short)
- Make sure there are no spaces or special characters in the path

## 🧪 Verification

The plugin has been tested and shows:
```
INFO:__main__:🔍 Trying multiple Claude connection methods...
INFO:__main__:✅ Connected using method 1: /Users/shanemattner/.nvm/versions/node/v23.7.0/bin/claude
INFO:__main__:Claude version: 1.0.62 (Claude Code)
```
