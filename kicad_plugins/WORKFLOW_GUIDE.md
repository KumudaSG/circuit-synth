# Circuit-Synth AI Workflow Guide

Optimized workflows for using AI-powered circuit analysis within KiCad's limitations and strengths.

## üéØ Understanding KiCad Limitations

### **Key Limitation**: Schematic Refresh
- **Issue**: Changes to schematic require closing/reopening to see updates
- **Impact**: AI analysis reflects the saved state, not current edits
- **Solution**: Strategic workflow planning

### **Our Approach**: AI-First Design Process
Instead of fighting the limitation, we embrace an AI-guided design methodology.

   ‚Ä¢ Ask: "Analyze my power system"
   ‚Ä¢ Ask: "Where should I add decoupling capacitors?"
   ‚Ä¢ Ask: "Are my voltage levels correct?"

2. üîã Power Planning
   ‚Ä¢ Document power requirements
   ‚Ä¢ Plan decoupling strategy
   ‚Ä¢ Identify regulation needs

3. üîå Implementation
   ‚Ä¢ Add power components systematically
   ‚Ä¢ Save and re-analyze periodically
   ‚Ä¢ Verify power delivery meets requirements
```

### **Workflow 4: Signal Integrity Review**

**Perfect for**: High-speed designs, connectivity issues

```
1. üîó Connectivity Analysis  
   ‚Ä¢ Ask: "Analyze my net connectivity"
   ‚Ä¢ Ask: "Are there high-fanout nets?"
   ‚Ä¢ Ask: "What signals might have integrity issues?"

2. üìê Layout Planning
   ‚Ä¢ Plan critical signal routing
   ‚Ä¢ Identify signals needing special care
   ‚Ä¢ Document layout constraints

3. ‚úÖ Implementation Verification
   ‚Ä¢ Make routing changes
   ‚Ä¢ Re-analyze connectivity
   ‚Ä¢ Verify improvements
```

## üí° Advanced Techniques

### **Technique 1: Progressive Analysis**

Break large designs into sections:

```
1. Analyze full design for overview
2. Ask about specific subsystems:
   ‚Ä¢ "Analyze just the microcontroller section"
   ‚Ä¢ "Focus on the power management"
   ‚Ä¢ "Review the communication interfaces"
3. Address each section systematically
```

### **Technique 2: Conversation Continuity**

Maintain context across sessions:

```
1. Keep chat interface open during work
2. Document changes as you make them:
   ‚Ä¢ "I'm adding a 100nF cap to U1 pin 8"
   ‚Ä¢ "I changed R5 from 1k to 4.7k"
3. Ask for feedback on changes:
   ‚Ä¢ "Does this change make sense?"
   ‚Ä¢ "What else should I consider?"
```

### **Technique 3: Export-Driven Documentation**

Use chat export for design documentation:

```
1. Conduct thorough AI analysis session
2. Ask comprehensive questions
3. Export chat history
4. Use as design documentation/rationale
5. Reference during PCB layout phase
```

## üîß Practical Session Examples

### **Example Session 1: New Design Review**

```
You: Analyze my new microcontroller circuit

AI: I see you have an STM32 with supporting components. Here's my analysis:
    ‚Ä¢ 15 components including MCU, crystals, regulators
    ‚Ä¢ Good use of decoupling capacitors
    ‚Ä¢ Missing: Boot mode selection resistors
    ‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Add pull-up on BOOT0 pin

You: What about the power system?

AI: Power analysis shows:
    ‚Ä¢ 3.3V regulation with AMS1117 - good choice
    ‚Ä¢ Input decoupling present
    ‚Ä¢ Missing: Output decoupling on 3.3V rail
    ‚Ä¢ Add 22uF + 100nF near MCU power pins
