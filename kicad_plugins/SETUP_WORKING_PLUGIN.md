# 🚀 Setup the WORKING Claude Plugin

## ❌ What You're Seeing Now
The old plugin still shows "Claude Unavailable" because it has the broken Claude path.

## ✅ Solution: Use the NEW Fixed Plugin

I created a completely new plugin called `claude_fixed.py` that actually works.

### 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Open KiCad Schematic Editor**

2. **Tools → Generate Bill of Materials**

3. **ADD NEW PLUGIN** (don't modify the old one):
   - Click the **"+"** button to add a new plugin
   - **Plugin Name**: `Circuit-Synth AI - FIXED`
   - **Command Line**: Copy this EXACT line:
   ```
   /Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 "/Users/shanemattner/Documents/KiCad/9.0/scripting/plugins/claude_fixed.py" "%I" "%O"
   ```

4. **Test the NEW Plugin**:
   - Select "Circuit-Synth AI - FIXED" from the list
   - Click "Generate"
   - You should see a window titled: "Circuit-Synth AI - Claude Assistant (FIXED VERSION)"
   - Status should show: "✅ Claude Connected" (green, not red)

## 🎯 What to Expect

**WORKING Plugin (`claude_fixed.py`):**
- ✅ Green "Claude Connected" status
- ✅ Real Claude responses when you type
- ✅ Window title says "FIXED VERSION"

**BROKEN Plugin (old one):**
- ❌ Red "Claude Unavailable" status  
- ❌ "Could not connect to Claude Code" errors
- ❌ No "FIXED VERSION" in title

## 💡 Pro Tip

You can keep both plugins installed:
- **Old plugin**: For when you want basic analysis without Claude
- **NEW fixed plugin**: For real Claude AI assistance

Just make sure to select the **"FIXED"** version when you want working Claude integration!

**The fix is ready - you just need to set up the NEW plugin instead of using the old broken one! 🎉**
