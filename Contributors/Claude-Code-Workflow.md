# Claude Code Development Workflow

This guide shows the **actual workflow used by the circuit-synth maintainers** for maximum productivity. We use Claude Code + GitHub MCP Server for end-to-end development management.

## 🚀 The Complete Claude Code + GitHub MCP Workflow

This is the **exact process** we use for all circuit-synth development:

```
Issue Creation → Branch Management → Development → PR Management → Merge
        ↓              ↓             ↓             ↓           ↓
   Claude Code ←→ GitHub MCP ←→ Codebase ←→ GitHub MCP ←→ CI/CD
```

### Why This Workflow is Revolutionary

- **Seamless GitHub Integration**: Claude Code reads issues, creates branches, manages PRs
- **Context Preservation**: All development context stays in Claude Code conversation
- **Automated Best Practices**: Follows conventions, runs tests, handles edge cases
- **End-to-End Management**: From issue to merge, everything in one interface

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Workflow

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis and Planning

**Claude Code automatically:**

```bash
# 1. Read and analyze GitHub issues
gh issue view 36  # Reads issue details, comments, labels

# 2. Understand the problem context
# Claude Code parses:
# - Issue description and requirements
# - Related issues and dependencies  
# - Performance data and logs
# - Acceptance criteria and scope

# 3. Create development plan
# Claude Code generates:
# - Technical approach and architecture
# - Task breakdown with priorities
# - Testing strategy and validation
# - Performance targets and benchmarks
```

**Real Example:**
```
👤 "Work on Issue #40 - rust component acceleration"

🤖 Claude Code:
   ✅ Reads Issue #40 details from GitHub
   ✅ Analyzes performance data (1796ms for 6 components)
   ✅ Reviews existing codebase patterns
   ✅ Creates technical implementation plan
   ✅ Identifies testing and benchmarking approach
```

### Phase 2: Branch Creation and Setup

**Claude Code handles branch management:**

```bash
# Claude Code automatically:

Fixes #40"

git push

# 2. Automated PR creation with rich context
gh pr create --title "feat: Rust Component Acceleration - 149x Performance Improvement" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Phase 5: PR Review and Updates

**Claude Code manages the entire review process:**

```bash
# 1. Monitors PR status and CI results
gh pr status  # Checks CI, reviews, conflicts

# 2. Responds to review feedback automatically
# - Addresses code review comments
# - Makes requested changes with explanations
# - Updates tests and documentation
# - Re-runs benchmarks and validation

# 3. Keeps issue updated with PR progress
# Links PR to issue with status updates
```

**Review Response Example:**
```markdown
