# 2025-07-30: Simulation Agent and Simplified Installation

## Summary
Added dedicated `simulation-expert` Claude agent and made PySpice simulation a default dependency instead of optional extra.

## Key Changes
- **New simulation-expert agent**: Provides comprehensive SPICE simulation assistance with circuit-synth integration expertise
- **Simplified installation**: PySpice now included by default - users get simulation capabilities immediately without complex setup
- **Updated documentation**: README and setup docs reflect streamlined installation process

## Impact
Users can now install circuit-synth and immediately access both simulation APIs and expert AI guidance for SPICE analysis and circuit validation.
