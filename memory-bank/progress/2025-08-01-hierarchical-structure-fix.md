# Hierarchical Structure Mismatch Resolution

## Summary
Successfully resolved the F8 PCB update hierarchical structure mismatch that was preventing proper schematic-to-PCB synchronization in circuit-synth.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by inconsistent hierarchical structure between schematic generation and PCB updates:
- Components had flat UUID associations instead of hierarchical paths
- Net naming was inconsistent between schematic and PCB representations
- Main circuit contained component definitions instead of clean net orchestration

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Debug Print Cleanup
- Removed excessive debug prints from `core/netlist_exporter.py`
- Cleaned up verbose logging in `kicad/netlist_exporter.py`
- Removed hierarchical debug spam from `kicad/netlist_service.py`
- Eliminated PCB generator debug clutter from `kicad/pcb_gen/pcb_generator.py`

### 2. Main Circuit Architecture Restructure
- Moved ESP32 component definition to separate `esp32c6.py` file
- Restructured `main.py` to only contain net definitions and subcircuit connections
- Eliminated complex net bridging logic in favor of direct net passing
- Implemented clean hierarchical circuit pattern

### 3. cs-new-project Template Improvements
- Updated template to follow proper architecture (ESP32 in separate circuit)
- Removed unused `simple_led.py` and `voltage_divider.py` files
- Cleaned up file naming: removed "_subcircuit" suffix
- Renamed ESP32 file to `esp32c6.py` for clarity
- Updated all function names and imports for consistency
- Simplified console output and removed library selection prompts

## Technical Impact

### F8 PCB Update Resolution
- **Before**: Hierarchical structure mismatch causing F8 update failures
- **After**: Clean hierarchical structure with proper component tracking
- **Evidence**: 0 warnings, 0 errors in both netlist and schematic update reports

### Component Management
- All components now have proper hierarchical paths like `/ESP32_C6_Dev_Board_Main/USB_Port/`
- Component UUIDs properly reference hierarchical structure
- Net naming consistent across schematic/PCB boundary
