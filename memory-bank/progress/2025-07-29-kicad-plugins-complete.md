# KiCad Plugins Integration Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented complete KiCad plugin system with AI-powered circuit analysis for both PCB and schematic editors. Includes breakthrough "BOM backdoor" method for schematic editor integration.

## Key Achievements
Created working plugins that provide native AI circuit analysis directly within KiCad interface. PCB plugin uses standard ActionPlugin framework, while schematic plugin uses innovative BOM tool backdoor approach to bypass eeschema API limitations.

## Technical Implementation
- **PCB Editor Plugin**: Uses pcbnew.ActionPlugin with comprehensive PCB and schematic analysis
- **Schematic Editor Plugin**: Leverages BOM tool XML netlist parsing with GUI analysis interface  
- **Installation System**: Automated installer with cross-platform compatibility
- **Documentation**: Complete installation guides and user documentation

## Impact
Provides professional AI-powered design assistance directly integrated into KiCad workflow, making circuit-synth framework accessible to KiCad users without leaving their familiar environment.
