# Docker Infrastructure Removal and Test Cleanup

## Summary
Removed entire Docker infrastructure (28 files, 2,872 lines) and replaced with local KiCad requirement. Added comprehensive KiCad validation system with cross-platform detection and user guidance.

## Key Changes
- Deleted docker/ directory and related scripts for simplified installation
- Added KiCadValidator class with validate-kicad CLI command
- Cleaned up skipped tests from 9 to 2, removing unreliable LLM-dependent tests

## Impact
Users now install with `pip install circuit-synth` + local KiCad instead of Docker complexity. Native KiCad performance with existing user preferences.
