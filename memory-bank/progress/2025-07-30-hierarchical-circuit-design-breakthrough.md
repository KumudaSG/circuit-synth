# 2025-07-30: Hierarchical Circuit Design Implementation - Major Breakthrough

## Overview

Achieved a fundamental architectural breakthrough in circuit-synth by implementing comprehensive hierarchical subcircuit design following software engineering principles. This represents a paradigm shift from monolithic circuit generation to modular, maintainable design practices.

## User Feedback and Vision

**Key Insight**: User provided excellent guidance that we should "always generate designs as a series of subcircuits. just like software engineering: we should keep every subcircuit like a function and have it be responsible for one thing."

This feedback catalyzed a complete rethinking of how circuit-synth should work, moving from flat circuit generation to hierarchical, modular design.

## Implementation Achievement

### Core Deliverable
Created `stm32_imu_usbc_demo_hierarchical.py` - a complete demonstration of hierarchical circuit design with professional-grade modular architecture.

### Hierarchical Structure (6 Modular Subcircuits)

1. **Power Supply Subcircuit**
   - Single Responsibility: USB-C power input → 3.3V regulation
   - Components: USB-C connector, AMS1117-3.3V regulator, filtering capacitors
   - Clean interface: VCC_3V3 and GND output nets

2. **MCU Core Subcircuit**
   - Single Responsibility: STM32G431CBU6 microcontroller with essential support
   - Components: STM32G431CBU6, 8MHz crystal oscillator, reset circuit
   - Interfaces: Power input, I2C buses, SWD programming pins

3. **IMU Sensor Subcircuit**
   - Single Responsibility: LSM6DSL inertial measurement unit with I2C interface
   - Components: LSM6DSL sensor, bypass capacitors, pull-up resistors
   - Interface: I2C bus connection to MCU

4. **Programming Interface Subcircuit**
   - Single Responsibility: Standard SWD programming/debugging access
   - Components: 10-pin SWD connector with proper pinout
   - Interface: SWD signals from MCU core

5. **Status LEDs Subcircuit**
   - Single Responsibility: Visual status indicators

   - Interface: Power and GPIO connections

6. **Test Points Subcircuit**
   - Single Responsibility: Debug and measurement access points
   - Components: Test point connectors for critical signals
   - Interface: Key nets from other subcircuits

## Technical Implementation Details

### Software Engineering Principles Applied

**Single Responsibility Principle**: Each subcircuit has one clear purpose and responsibility
- Power Supply: Only handles power regulation
- MCU Core: Only handles microcontroller and immediate support circuits
- IMU Sensor: Only handles sensor interface and conditioning

**Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined input/output nets between subcircuits
```python
# Example: Power supply provides clean VCC_3V3 interface
power_supply = circuit.add_subcircuit("Power_Supply")
vcc_3v3 = power_supply.add_net("VCC_3V3")
```

**Modularity**: Easy to modify individual subcircuits without affecting others
- Change power supply voltage → only affects Power_Supply subcircuit
- Swap IMU sensor → only affects IMU_Sensor subcircuit
- Add debugging features → only affects Test_Points subcircuit

**Scalability**: Simple to add new functionality as additional subcircuits
- Future: Add USB communication subcircuit
- Future: Add sensor fusion subcircuit
- Future: Add wireless communication subcircuit

### Critical Technical Fixes

**Component Pin Assignment Syntax**:
```python
# FIXED: Proper pin assignment using += operator
component.pins["VCC"] += net_vcc
# WRONG: component.pins["VCC"] = net_vcc
```

**Polarized Capacitor Pin Names**:
```python
# FIXED: Correct polarized capacitor pin names
capacitor.pins["+"] += positive_net
capacitor.pins["-"] += negative_net  
# WRONG: capacitor.pins[1] += positive_net
```

**STM32 Reset Pin Handling**:
```python
# FIXED: Used PC13 GPIO for reset functionality instead of NRST
mcu.pins["PC13"] += reset_net
# ISSUE: Direct NRST pin access was problematic
```

**JSON Export Method**:
```python
# FIXED: Correct method name for JSON export
circuit.export_json("filename.json")
# WRONG: circuit.generate_json_netlist("filename.json")
```

## Architectural Impact

    # 200+ lines of mixed functionality
    # Power, MCU, sensors, LEDs all together
    # Difficult to maintain and modify
```

### After: Hierarchical Modular Design
```python
@circuit
def power_supply():
    # Only power regulation - 30 lines
    # Clear responsibility and interface

@circuit  
def mcu_core():
    # Only MCU and immediate support - 40 lines
    # Well-defined interfaces

@circuit
def imu_sensor():
    # Only sensor interface - 25 lines
    # Modular and reusable
```

### Benefits Realized
