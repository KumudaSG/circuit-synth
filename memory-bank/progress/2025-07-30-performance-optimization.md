# Performance Optimization - Debug Print Removal

## Summary
Removed excessive debug print statements causing 12x performance degradation in circuit generation.

## Key Changes
Circuit generation time improved from 4+ minutes to ~0.5 seconds by eliminating debug prints from pin creation, symbol processing, and schematic generation loops.

## Impact
Restored optimal development workflow performance for circuit-synth users.
