# cs-init-pcb Complete Claude Agent System Fix

## Summary
Fixed `cs-init-pcb` to copy complete Claude agent system with all specialized agents and slash commands, creating a professional circuit-synth environment.

## Problem Identified
- `.claude/` directory was being created but was incomplete
- Missing specialized agents directory with 7 agent files
- Missing commands directory with 7 slash command files  
- Missing README.md and settings.json for complete Claude Code integration

## Solution Implemented
- Updated `create_claude_agent()` function to copy complete `.claude/` structure from `example_project/`
- Now copies all agent files: circuit-architect, circuit-synth, jlc-parts-finder, etc.
- Now copies all command files: find-symbol, find-footprint, generate-circuit, etc.
- Enhanced `instructions.md` with documentation about available agents and commands
- Added fallback behavior when example project is not found

## Files Now Created by cs-init-pcb
```
.claude/
├── agents/                    # 7 specialized AI agents
│   ├── circuit-architect.md
│   ├── circuit-synth.md
│   ├── jlc-parts-finder.md
│   └── ...

├── README.md                 # Claude agent system documentation
└── settings.json            # Claude Code configuration
```

## Impact
Users running `cs-init-pcb` now get:
- ✅ Complete professional circuit-synth environment
- ✅ All specialized AI agents for different tasks
- ✅ All slash commands for quick operations
- ✅ Proper Claude Code integration and documentation
- ✅ Ready-to-use AI-powered circuit design workflow

## Testing Verified
- ✅ All agent files copied correctly
- ✅ All command files copied correctly
- ✅ settings.json and README.md copied
- ✅ Customized instructions.md created for specific project
- ✅ Console shows "Created complete Claude agent system with all agents and commands"
