# KiCad Plugin Implementation Success

## Summary
Successfully created and installed Circuit-Synth AI plugin for KiCad 9. Plugin appears in Tools â†’ External Plugins menu and can access PCB data (components, tracks, board info).

## Key Technical Change
Fixed plugin installation by using correct KiCad scripting directory structure (`~/Documents/KiCad/9.0/scripting/plugins/`) and proper ActionPlugin class registration pattern.

## Impact
Users can now access AI-powered circuit design assistance directly from KiCad's PCB Editor interface.
