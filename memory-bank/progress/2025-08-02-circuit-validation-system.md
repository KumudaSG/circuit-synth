# Circuit Validation System Implementation

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive circuit validation system that automatically checks and improves circuit code quality, providing instant feedback and fixes for common issues.

## Key Features Added
1. **validate_and_improve_circuit()** - Core validation function with automatic fixing
2. **get_circuit_design_context()** - Context-aware circuit generation assistance
3. **Enhanced circuit agent** - Validated circuit generation with quality assurance
4. **New Claude Code commands** - `/generate-validated-circuit` and `/validate-existing-circuit`

## Technical Implementation
- Pure Python validation using AST parsing and subprocess execution
- Context-specific design patterns (power, MCU, USB, analog)
- Automatic import fixing and syntax error detection
- Runtime validation with timeout protection
- Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate

## Impact
- Eliminates common circuit code errors before users see them
- Provides intelligent code improvements and fixes
- Reduces development time with context-aware generation
- Enhances code quality and reliability standards
