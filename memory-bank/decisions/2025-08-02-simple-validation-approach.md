# Simple Validation Architecture Decision

## Decision
Implemented a lightweight "Super Simple" validation approach with just two core functions instead of a complex multi-class system.

## Rationale
- **70% of benefits with 10% complexity** - focuses on the most critical validation needs
- **Pure Python implementation** - no external dependencies or Docker containers
- **Single function calls** - eliminates multiple tool calls and context management overhead
- **Claude Code integration** - works seamlessly with existing agent architecture

## Architecture
- `validate_and_improve_circuit()` - handles syntax, imports, and runtime validation
- `get_circuit_design_context()` - provides comprehensive design context in one call
- Enhanced circuit agent with built-in validation workflow
- New Claude Code commands for user-friendly access

## Benefits Delivered
- Automatic import fixing and syntax error detection
- Context-aware circuit generation with best practices
- Runtime validation with proper error handling
- Professional quality assurance workflow integration
