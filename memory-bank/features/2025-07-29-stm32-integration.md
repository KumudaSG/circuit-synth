**Usage Example**:
```python
from circuit_synth.stm32_pinout import STM32PinMapper

mapper = STM32PinMapper("g4-31_41", "external_repos/modm-devices")

# Find pins for specific peripheral
usart_pins = mapper.find_pins_for_peripheral("usart1", "tx")

# Complete pin assignment for multiple requirements
requirements = {"usart1_tx": "tx", "spi1_sck": "sck"}
assignments = mapper.suggest_pin_assignment(requirements)
```

### 5. Claude Code Command
**Location**: `.claude/commands/find-stm32-mcu.md`
**Command**: `/find-stm32-mcu [project requirements]`

**Example Usage**:
```bash
/find-stm32-mcu IoT project with WiFi, 2 UARTs, SPI, I2C, low power
/find-stm32-mcu Motor controller for 3-phase BLDC with encoder feedback
