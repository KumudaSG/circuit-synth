# Circuit Memory-Bank System: Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Circuit Memory-Bank System automatically preserves design decisions, fabrication history, and project knowledge across PCB projects. This system integrates seamlessly with Claude Code and circuit-synth to provide intelligent, automatic documentation that grows with each project.

## Core Vision

**"Automatic engineering documentation with proactive project management"**

- **Automatic**: Agents silently update memory-bank in background during normal work
- **Intelligent**: Circuit-synth powered diff analysis understands electrical changes
- **Nested**: Each PCB variant has its own memory-bank with project-level aggregation
- **Proactive**: System can ask questions and set reminders based on project state
- **Simple**: All data stored in human-readable markdown files

## Project Scope & Timeline

- **Timeline**: Long-term project with iterative development
- **Approach**: Implement complete system at once with phased testing
- **Priority**: Focus on automatic integration and silent background operation
- **Future**: Eventually package as standalone Python package for broader use

### Multi-Level Agent System

**Project-Level Agent** (`project-root/.claude/`)
- Aggregates information from all PCB-level agents
- Maintains cross-project knowledge and insights
- Handles vendor analysis and component database
- Provides project-wide status and reporting

**PCB-Level Agents** (`pcbs/board-name/.claude/`)
- Focused on individual PCB variant development
- Maintains PCB-specific memory-bank files
- Handles commit analysis and change detection
- Manages fabrication tracking and testing records

### Context Switching System

**cs-switch-board Command**
```bash
# Switch to specific PCB context
cs-switch-board esp32-sensor-v1

# List available boards
cs-switch-board --list

# Show current context
cs-switch-board --status
```

**Claude Code Integration**:
The `cs-switch-board` command integrates directly with Claude Code's memory management:

1. **Memory Compression**: Triggers Claude to compress current conversation context to minimum
2. **Context Switch**: Changes active .claude configuration and memory-bank scope
3. **Fresh Load**: Claude reads new PCB-level .claude instructions and memory-bank files
4. **Seamless Transition**: User continues conversation in new PCB context without restart

**Implementation**:
```python
def switch_board_with_claude_integration(board_name):
    # Signal Claude Code to compress memory
    trigger_claude_memory_compression()
    
    # Update context configuration
    update_context_config(board_name)
    
    # Signal Claude Code to reload .claude files
    trigger_claude_context_reload(f"pcbs/{board_name}/.claude/")
    
    print(f"🔄 Compressed memory and switched to: {board_name}")
    print(f"📋 Loaded PCB-specific instructions from pcbs/{board_name}/.claude/")
    print(f"🧠 Memory-bank scope: pcbs/{board_name}/memory-bank/")
```

## Core Features

### 1. Automatic Memory-Bank Updates

**Trigger Events**:
- Git commits (primary trigger)
- Circuit-synth command execution
- User questions about design
- Test/simulation runs

**Silent Operation**:
- Updates happen in background
- Brief status messages: "Updated memory-bank with component decision"
- No interruption to primary workflow
- Graceful degradation if updates fail

### 2. Intelligent Commit Analysis

**Circuit Diff Analysis**:
```python
# Pseudocode for commit analysis
def analyze_commit(commit_hash):
    # Get changed files
    changed_files = git.get_changed_files(commit_hash)
    
    for file in changed_files:
        if file.endswith('.kicad_sch'):
            # Parse current and previous versions
            current_circuit = kicad_to_python(file)
            previous_circuit = kicad_to_python(get_previous_version(file))
            
            # Generate intelligent diff
            diff = compare_circuits(current_circuit, previous_circuit)
            
            # Update memory-bank with changes
            update_decisions_md(diff, commit_message)
```

**Change Detection Scope**:
- Component additions/removals/value changes
- Net connectivity modifications
- Pin assignment changes
- Footprint updates
- Symbol library changes

**Memory-Bank Updates**:
- Add entries to `decisions.md` with rationale
- Update `timeline.md` with milestone progress
- Log issues in `issues.md` if problems detected
- Cache circuit representation for future comparisons

### 3. Standard File Structure

**decisions.md Format**:

## Technical Implementation Details

### Context Switching Implementation

**Recommended Approach**: Config file based context switching
```python
# ~/.circuit-synth-context or project-root/.circuit-synth-context
{
    "current_project": "/path/to/project",
    "current_pcb": "esp32-sensor-v1",
    "last_updated": "2025-08-03T14:30:00Z"
}
```

**cs-switch-board Command**:
```python
def switch_board(board_name):
    # Validate board exists
    if not os.path.exists(f"pcbs/{board_name}"):
        raise ValueError(f"Board {board_name} not found")
    
    # Update context file
    context = {
        "current_project": os.getcwd(),
        "current_pcb": board_name,
        "last_updated": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    with open(".circuit-synth-context", "w") as f:
        json.dump(context, f, indent=2)
    
    print(f"Switched to board: {board_name}")
    print(f"Memory-bank: pcbs/{board_name}/memory-bank/")
```

### Circuit Diff Analysis

**Circuit Comparison Logic**:
```python
def compare_circuits(current, previous):
    diff = {
        "components": {
            "added": [],
            "removed": [],
            "modified": []
        },
        "nets": {
            "added": [],
            "removed": [],
            "modified": []
        },
        "values": {
            "changed": []
        }
    }
    
    # Component analysis
    current_refs = {c.ref: c for c in current.components}
    previous_refs = {c.ref: c for c in previous.components}
    
    # Find added/removed components
    diff["components"]["added"] = [
        ref for ref in current_refs if ref not in previous_refs
    ]
    diff["components"]["removed"] = [
        ref for ref in previous_refs if ref not in current_refs
    ]
    
    # Find modified components
    for ref in current_refs:
        if ref in previous_refs:
            if current_refs[ref] != previous_refs[ref]:
                diff["components"]["modified"].append({
                    "ref": ref,
                    "changes": get_component_changes(
                        current_refs[ref], 
                        previous_refs[ref]
                    )
                })
    
    return diff
```

### Memory-Bank Update Engine

**Silent Update System**:
```python
class MemoryBankUpdater:
    def __init__(self, pcb_path):
        self.pcb_path = pcb_path
        self.memory_bank_path = os.path.join(pcb_path, "memory-bank")
        
    def update_from_commit(self, commit_hash):
        try:
            # Analyze commit changes
            changes = self.analyze_commit(commit_hash)
            
            # Update appropriate memory-bank files
            if changes["components"]:
                self.update_decisions_md(changes, commit_hash)
            if changes["timeline_worthy"]:
                self.update_timeline_md(changes, commit_hash)
            if changes["issues"]:
                self.update_issues_md(changes, commit_hash)
                
            # Cache current circuit state
            self.cache_circuit_state()
            
            print(f"✓ Updated memory-bank with commit {commit_hash[:7]}")
            
        except Exception as e:
            # Graceful degradation - log error but don't interrupt workflow
            print(f"⚠ Memory-bank update failed: {e}")
            self.log_error(e, commit_hash)
```

### File Format Standards

**Generated CLAUDE.md Template**:
```python
CLAUDE_MD_TEMPLATE = """# CLAUDE.md - {project_name}

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working on the {project_name} project.

## Memory-Bank System

This project uses the Circuit Memory-Bank System for automatic engineering documentation and project knowledge preservation.

### Overview
The memory-bank system automatically tracks:
- **Design Decisions**: Component choices and rationale
- **Fabrication History**: PCB orders, delivery, and assembly
- **Testing Results**: Performance data and issue resolution
- **Timeline Events**: Project milestones and key dates
- **Cross-Board Insights**: Knowledge shared between PCB variants

### Multi-Level Agent System

This project uses a nested agent structure:

```
{project_name}/
├── .claude/                    # Project-level agent
├── pcbs/
│   ├── {board_1}/
│   │   ├── .claude/           # PCB-level agent
│   │   └── memory-bank/       # PCB-specific documentation
│   └── {board_2}/
│       ├── .claude/           # Independent PCB agent
│       └── memory-bank/       # Independent documentation
```

### Context Switching

Use the `cs-switch-board` command to work on specific PCBs:

```bash
# Switch to specific board context
cs-switch-board {board_1}

# List available boards
cs-switch-board --list

# Check current context
cs-switch-board --status
```

**Important**: `cs-switch-board` will compress Claude's memory and reload the appropriate .claude configuration. This ensures you're working with the right context and memory-bank scope.

### Memory-Bank Files

Each PCB maintains standard memory-bank files:

- **decisions.md**: Component choices, design rationale, alternatives considered
- **fabrication.md**: PCB orders, delivery tracking, assembly notes
- **testing.md**: Test results, measurements, performance validation
- **timeline.md**: Project milestones, key events, deadlines
- **issues.md**: Problems encountered, root causes, solutions

### Automatic Documentation

The system automatically updates memory-bank files when you:
- Make git commits (primary trigger)
- Run circuit-synth commands
- Ask questions about the design
- Perform tests or measurements

**Best Practices for Commits**:
- Use descriptive commit messages explaining **why** changes were made
- Commit frequently to capture incremental design decisions
- Include context about alternatives considered
- Mention any testing or validation performed

Examples:
```bash
# Good commit messages for memory-bank
git commit -m "Switch to buck converter for better efficiency - tested 90% vs 60% with linear reg"
git commit -m "Add external crystal for USB stability - internal RC caused enumeration failures"
git commit -m "Increase decoupling cap to 22uF - scope showed 3.3V rail noise during WiFi tx"
```

### Memory-Bank Commands

```bash
# Initialize memory-bank in existing project
cs-memory-bank-init

# Remove memory-bank system
cs-memory-bank-remove

# Check memory-bank status
cs-memory-bank-status

# Search memory-bank content
cs-memory-bank-search "voltage regulator"
```

### Troubleshooting

**Context Issues**:
- If Claude seems confused about which board you're working on, use `cs-switch-board --status`
- Use `cs-switch-board {board_name}` to explicitly set context

**Memory-Bank Updates Not Working**:
- Ensure you're committing through git (primary trigger for updates)
- Check that memory-bank files exist in current board directory
- Verify .claude configuration includes memory-bank instructions

**File Corruption**:
- All memory-bank files are in git - use `git checkout` to recover
- Use `cs-memory-bank-init` to recreate missing template files

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Approach

**Test Project Setup**:
1. Create new test project: `cs-new-project "Memory-Bank Test"`
2. Add simple ESP32 circuit with basic components
3. Make several commits with different types of changes:
   - Component additions (resistors, capacitors)
   - Value changes (resistor values, capacitor values)
   - Net connectivity changes
   - Symbol/footprint updates

**Test Scenarios**:
```bash
# Test 1: Basic memory-bank creation
cs-new-project "test-project"
# Verify: Standard directory structure created
# Verify: Template files contain example content

# Test 2: Context switching
cs-switch-board esp32-v1
cs-switch-board --list
cs-switch-board --status
# Verify: Context persists across Claude Code sessions

# Test 3: Commit analysis
# Make commit with component changes
git add . && git commit -m "Add power supply components"
# Verify: decisions.md updated with component rationale
# Verify: timeline.md shows milestone progress

# Test 4: Circuit diff analysis  
# Modify component values in KiCad
# Save and commit changes
# Verify: Diff correctly identifies value changes
# Verify: Memory-bank explains impact of changes

# Test 5: Multi-level agents
# Work from project root, then PCB directory
# Verify: Different .claude contexts work correctly
# Verify: Project-level agent aggregates PCB-level info
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Memory-bank files created automatically
- [ ] Commit analysis correctly identifies circuit changes
- [ ] Context switching works reliably
- [ ] Updates happen silently without interrupting workflow
- [ ] Multi-level agent system functions properly
- [ ] Error handling gracefully degrades

### Automated Testing (Future)

**Unit Tests**:
- Circuit diff analysis accuracy
- Memory-bank file parsing and generation
- Context switching logic
- Git commit analysis

**Integration Tests**:
- End-to-end workflow from commit to memory-bank update
- Multi-PCB project handling
- Agent communication between levels

## Future Enhancements

### Proactive Timer System

**Implementation Concept**:
```markdown
# Timeline with Reminders

## 2025-08-15: PCB Order Placed
**Order**: JLCPCB-123456
**Expected Delivery**: 2025-08-22
**Reminder**: Check delivery status on 2025-08-23
**Boards Needed**: 20 pieces for production run by 2025-09-01

## 2025-08-10: Testing Phase Started
**Milestone**: Power supply validation
**Expected Completion**: 2025-08-17
**Reminder**: Follow up on test results if not completed by target date
```

**Proactive Questions**:
- "It's been 2 weeks since you ordered boards from JLCPCB. Did they arrive?"
- "You need 20 boards by September 1st but only ordered 10. Should we place another order?"
- "Last time this regulator failed at high temperature. Want to test thermal performance?"
- "This is the 3rd iteration of the power supply. Should we document the design evolution?"

### User Experience Risks
**Context Switching Complexity**: Users might find multi-directory system confusing
- *Mitigation*: Clear status indicators, helpful error messages
- *Fallback*: Allow working from project root with explicit board selection

**Information Overload**: Too much automatic documentation could be overwhelming
- *Mitigation*: Focus on significant changes, clear organization
- *Fallback*: Configurable verbosity levels

## Conclusion

The Circuit Memory-Bank System represents a significant advancement in PCB design workflow automation. By seamlessly integrating with Claude Code and circuit-synth, it provides intelligent, automatic documentation that preserves engineering knowledge and enables proactive project management.

The system's strength lies in its **silent operation** - engineers can continue their normal workflow while the system automatically builds a comprehensive knowledge base. This approach removes the traditional barriers to documentation (time, effort, memory) while providing immediate value through intelligent change analysis and cross-project insights.

The **multi-level agent architecture** enables both focused PCB-specific work and broader project-level analysis, matching the natural hierarchy of hardware design projects. The **context switching system** allows engineers to seamlessly move between different board designs while maintaining proper documentation scope.

By storing all data in **human-readable markdown files**, the system maintains transparency and user confidence while enabling easy integration with existing tools and workflows. The eventual extraction to a **standalone package** will allow this innovation to benefit other engineering domains beyond circuit design.

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap from basic functionality to advanced features, with concrete testing strategies and success metrics. The system will significantly improve engineering productivity while building valuable institutional knowledge that grows with each project.
