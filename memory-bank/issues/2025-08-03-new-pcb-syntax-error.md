# CS-New-PCB Syntax Error Issue

## Problem Description
`uv run cs-new-pcb "esp32 sensor board"` fails with:
```
SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal (detected at line 1110)
```

## File Location
`/Users/shanemattner/Desktop/circuit-synth4/src/circuit_synth/tools/new_pcb.py`

## Investigation Status
- File content appears correct when reading in sections
- `python -m py_compile` and AST parsing both fail
- Error reported at line 1110, but content around that line looks proper
- Likely hidden character or malformed string literal somewhere in file

## Debugging Approach Needed
1. **Binary search method**: Comment out sections to isolate error location
2. **Character encoding check**: Look for non-ASCII characters or hidden chars
3. **String literal audit**: Search for all triple-quoted strings and verify termination
4. **Template string check**: Examine f-strings and docstring templates for issues

## Reproduction Steps
```bash
cd /Users/shanemattner/Desktop/circuit-synth4
uv run cs-new-pcb "test board"
```

## Expected Behavior
Should copy `/Users/shanemattner/Desktop/circuit-synth4/example_project/circuit-synth/` to new project directory.

## Context
This error is blocking the completion of the copy functionality implementation. The core logic is correct, but syntax error prevents execution.
